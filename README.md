# Hypervisor-like Service for MLOps Platform

## Overview
This is a FastAPI-based technical assessment designed to evaluate backend system design and implementation skills. The project implements a cluster management system with session-based authentication, organization management, and deployment scheduling.

## Assessment Tasks

### 1. User Authentication and Organization Management
- âœ… Implement session-based user authentication (login/logout)
- âœ… Complete user registration with password hashing
- âœ… Add organization creation with random invite codes
- âœ… Implement organization joining via invite codes

### 2. Cluster Management
- âœ… Create clusters with resource limits (CPU, RAM, GPU)
- âœ… Implement resource tracking and availability
- âœ… Add cluster listing for organization members
- âœ… Validate resource constraints

### 3. Deployment Management
- âœ… Develop a preemption-based scheduling algorithm to prioritize high-priority deployments
- âœ… Create deployment endpoints with resource requirements
- âœ… Implement basic scheduling algorithm
- âœ… Implement Priority, Preemption based scheduling algorithm 
- âœ… Add deployment status tracking
- âœ… Handle resource allocation/deallocation

### 4. Advanced Features (Optional)
- ðŸ’¡ Add support for deployment dependency management (e.g., Deployment A must complete before Deployment B starts)
  - Above feature can be implemented using a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for deployment dependencies.
  - Kahn's Algorithm can be used to implement the topological sorting of the DAG. 
  - Current Implementation of priority based scheduling for each cluster shall be extended to use kahn's algorithm
- âœ… Implement Basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- âœ… Add rate limiting
- âœ… Create comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… Enhance API documentation

```

## Authentication Flow
1. Register a new user (`POST /api/v1/auth/register`)
2. Login with credentials (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`)
   - Server sets a secure session cookie
3. Use session cookie for authenticated requests
4. Logout when finished (`POST /api/v1/auth/logout`)

## Organization Management
1. Create organization (generates invite code)
2. Share invite code with team members
3. Members join using invite code
4. Access organization resources (clusters, deployments)

## Cluster Management
1. create clusters with resource limits (CPU, RAM, GPU)
2. Clusters are created under organization of user
2. List clusters for organization members

## Deployment Management**
1. Create a deployment for any cluster by providing a Docker image path, resource requirements (CPU, RAM, GPU), and priority.
2. Resource Allocation for Deployment**: Each deployment requires a certain amount of resources (RAM, CPU, GPU).
3. Queue Deployments**: The deployment should be queued if the resources are unavailable in the cluster.
4. Preemption: Implemented a preemption-based scheduling algorithm to prioritize high-priority deployments.
5. Deployment Status Tracking: Track the status of each deployment (Queued, Running, Completed, Failed).
6. Resource Deallocation: Deallocate resources once the deployment is completed or failed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database

### Setup Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
   - On Windows:
   ```bash:
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
#### Note: If you encounter "command not found" Error, Make sure to activate the virtual environment before running following commands

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest --disable-warnings
```

## Design
- The application uses FastAPI for building the RESTful API.
- SQLAlchemy is used for database management.
- Pydantic is used for data validation and serialization.
- Redis is used for deployment queue and resource tracking.
- The application uses session-based authentication.
- The application uses a preemption-based scheduling algorithm for deployment prioritization.
- The application uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for user permissions.
- Since the application is a prototype, the deployment queue is managed in-memory
- ### Decisions
- The application uses a custom base class for SQLAlchemy models to avoid code duplication.
- Organization members are stored in a separate table to manage user roles and permissions.
- Scheduler is created as interface and implemented as PreemptiveScheduler for deployment prioritization.
- Deployment of only same cluster are queued and prioritized while deployments of different clusters are independent.
- Hence, the application uses a single deployment queue for each cluster achieving the decoupling and parallelism for processing deployments for clusters
